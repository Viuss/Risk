Logic:
  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  Trade in cards positioning might have to be changed

Adam:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_ROLL stage and broadcasts moves made locally over network.
  Ask reps: Should cards be traded in on player defeat or at the start of a turn?

  Re-visit the NetworkPlayer after dice roll is implemented to check it works. 
  	Currently not possible due to different games getting different answers to dice rolls.
	Though I could probably hard code dice rolls to be 4 or something for testing...

  Also need to handle us leaving the game when we win / lose.

  logic.Move stages to implement until entire game should be possible;
            Trade in cards doesn't work if the player wants to trade in cards.
            case DECIDE_ATTACK:
            case START_ATTACK:
            case CHOOSE_ATTACK_DICE:
            case CHOOSE_DEFEND_DICE:
            case ROLL_HASH:
            case ROLL_NUMBER:

  Parts of the protocol to implement:
	Dice Roll
1.		Parse DICE_ROLL, DICE_HASH, DICE_NUMBER messages
4.		Handle these messages appropriately when needed in NetworkPlayer
3.	Card Shuffle (basically just a dice roll)
	Host must timeout players
	Message Signing: 
2.		Wrapper Format mandatory
		Store public_keys from players joined, use to verify messages.
	Revisit the lobby protocol: 
		not sure if initialise_game is currently sent,
		ping meaning / format changed
		ready meaning / format changed
		name and public key added to join_game
		handle receiving players_joined command
