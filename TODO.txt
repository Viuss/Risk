Logic:
  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  CardsStrategy.StartAttack is broken, Agents that used it now use RandomStrategy (Continental + Greedy)


Adam:
Refactoring:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_HASH/NUMBER stages and broadcasts moves made locally over network.
    Reduces the complexity in NetworkPlayer::updatePlayer.

Work remaining for our version of networked risk:
3.  Handle leaving the game when we win / lose.
1.	Card Shuffle (basically just a dice roll)
2.  Player Order shuffle (same as card shuffle)
4.  Handle NetworkPlayer disconnection.

  Work to be done to play with other implementations:
1.	Wrapper Format
3.  Send name in join_game
4.  Handle players_joined command
5.  Delete draw_card command.
6.  ack_id should start at zero and increment by one for each message. We currently just generate a random number.
7.	Host must timeout players
8.  Ensure unknown messages are ignored by the game (Other groups might implement Chat for example)
9.  Stop receiving PING messages when host sends READY command.

  Protocol Extensions:
1.  Message Signing (Store public_keys from players joined, use to verify messages.)
