Logic:
  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  CardsStrategy.StartAttack is broken, Agents that used it now use RandomStrategy (Continental + Greedy)



Adam:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_HASH/NUMBER stages and broadcasts moves made locally over network.

Work remaining for our version of networked risk:
1.  Handle leaving the game when we win / lose.
2.	Card Shuffle (basically just a dice roll)
3.  Handle NetworkPlayer disconnection.

  Work to be done to play with other implementations:
1.	Wrapper Format
3.  Send name in join_game
4.  Handle players_joined command
5.  Delete draw_card command.
6.  ack_id should start at zero and increment by one for each message. We currently just generate a random number.
7.	Host must timeout players
8. Ensure unknown messages are ignored by the game (Other groups might implement Chat for example)

  Protocol Extensions:
1.  Message Signing (Store public_keys from players joined, use to verify messages.)
