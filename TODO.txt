Adam:
Refactoring:
  LobbyUtil.createIPlayersInOrder could do with a second look at some point. It's really complicated for no great reason.


Adam's list of things to do which will actually get done:

========== At this point we should be able to test with Saad's group ============
1. in NetworkPlayer, if we ever can't receive a message, tell the Game Logic we should be a neutral player.

-------- Not likely to get done
Maybe stop receiveing PING messages when the host sends READY. This requires quite a re-architecture of the lobby code as far as I can tell
Maybe Check that unknown messages are ignored by the game at all important points.
Maybe also check that the host forwards unknown messages. The host should probably just forward line by line instead of parsing and resending. Does this happen already?
Maybe also timeout players if they take way too long. I'm not so keen on this though really.
------- Never actually going to get done.
Never implement message signing, nice idea but no group is going to get far enough to cheat. Talk about the theory in the report, because quite a lot of thought was put into this.
