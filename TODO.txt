Logic:
  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  CardsStrategy.StartAttack is broken, Agents that used it now use RandomStrategy (Continental + Greedy)



Adam:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_HASH/NUMBER stages and broadcasts moves made locally over network.

Work remaining for our version of networked risk:
1.  Handle leaving the game when we win / lose.
2.	Card Shuffle (basically just a dice roll)
3.  Handle NetworkPlayer disconnection.

  Work to be done to play with other implementations:
1.	Wrapper Format
2.	Send initialise_game
3.  Send name in join_game
4.  Handle players_joined command
5.  ping meaning / format changed
6.  ready meaning / format changed
7.  Delete draw_card command.
8.  ack_id should start at zero and increment by one for each message. We currently just generate a random number.
9.  Acknowledgement payload should just be an integer (or long?)
10.	Host must timeout players
11. Ensure unknown messages are ignored by the game (Other groups might implement Chat for example)

  Protocol Extensions:
1.  Message Signing (Store public_keys from players joined, use to verify messages.)
