Logic:
  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  CardsStrategy.StartAttack is broken, Agents that used it now use RandomStrategy (Continental + Greedy)



Adam:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_HASH/NUMBER stages and broadcasts moves made locally over network.

Work to be done to have a networked risk game:
1.  logic.Move stages to implement until all logic will be networked;
        Trade in cards doesn't work if the player wants to trade in cards.
        case DECIDE_ATTACK:
        case START_ATTACK:
        case CHOOSE_ATTACK_DICE:
        case CHOOSE_DEFEND_DICE:
        case ROLL_HASH:
        case ROLL_NUMBER:
        case OCCUPY_TERRITORY:
        case DECIDE_FORTIFY:
        case START_FORTIFY:
        case FORTIFY_TERRITORY:

2.  Handle leaving the game when we win / lose.
3.  Handle NetworkPlayer disconnection.
4.	Card Shuffle (basically just a dice roll)

  Work to be done to play with other implementations:
1.	Wrapper Format
2.	Send initialise_game is currently sent,
3.  Send name in join_game
4.  Handle players_joined command
5.  ping meaning / format changed
6.  ready meaning / format changed
8.  Delete draw_card command.
7.	Host must timeout players

  Protocol Extensions:
1.  Message Signing (Store public_keys from players joined, use to verify messages.)
