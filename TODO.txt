Logic:
  RC4 dice roll stream (Dice rolls all done server side, don't get dice rolls from user) (in protocol, need more info)

  Abstract the randomness, (put all randomness into classes with its own interface/implementation)

  Create logging system

  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  Add DICEROll stage for each move that returns 256 bit int

  Each IPlayer implementation should call a method from some networking somewhere

  logic creates new RNG(256bitint)
  rng.getDiceRolls(5);

  Trade in cards positioning might have to be changed

  When should threads exit

Things:
  Decided how threading will work between UI / Lobby / Logic / Network
  Decided how card shuffling will work
  Decided how dice rolls will work
  Talk about Lobby -> Map UI integration
  How to send messages on behalf of local player
