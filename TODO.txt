Logic:
  Add unit tests / MoveChecker stuff ROLL_HASH and ROLL_NUMBER

  Implement generation of Int256()

  Do the xor stuff with Int256s in logic.rng.RNG

  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

  Trade in cards positioning might have to be changed

  When should threads exit






Adam:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_ROLL stage and broadcasts moves made locally over network.
  Ask reps: Should cards be traded in on player defeat or at the start of a turn?
  logic.Move stages to implement until entire game should be possible;
            case PLACE_ARMIES:
            case DECIDE_ATTACK:
            case START_ATTACK:
            case CHOOSE_ATTACK_DICE:
            case CHOOSE_DEFEND_DICE:
            case OCCUPY_TERRITORY:
            case DECIDE_FORTIFY:
            case START_FORTIFY:
            case FORTIFY_TERRITORY:
  Parts of the protocol to implement:
	Dice Roll
	Card Shuffle (basically just a dice roll)
	Host must timeout players
	Message Signing: 
		Wrapper Format mandatory
		Store public_keys from players joined, use to verify messages.
	Revisit the lobby protocol: 
		not sure if initialise_game is currently sent,
		ping meaning / format changed
		ready meaning / format changed
		name and public key added to join_game
		handle receiving players_joined command
