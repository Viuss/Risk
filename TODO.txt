Logic:
  Make tests for all methods that take in IPlayer input

  implement leave game functionality including neutral territories (in protocol)

  RC4 dice roll stream (Dice rolls all done server side, don't get dice rolls from user) (in protocol, need more info)

  Abstract the randomness, (put all randomness into classes with its own interface/implementation)

  Remove magic numbers

  Add dice rolls to Move

  Add player names to IPlayer

  Move Game.check_move() into move checker

Protocol:
  What happens when the deck runs out of cards?
