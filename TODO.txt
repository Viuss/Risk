Lgic:
  Add a timeout feature to stop AIs from taking too long

Adam:
Refactoring:
  NetworkLocalPlayer to wrap local IPlayers: Implements DICE_HASH/NUMBER stages and broadcasts moves made locally over network.
    Reduces the complexity in NetworkPlayer::updatePlayer.
  LobbyUtil.createIPlayersInOrder could do with a second look at some point. It's really complicated for no great reason.


Adam's list of things to do which will actually get done:

1. Card shuffle. Mostly there thanks to Nathan, just needs to add in the Networked dice roll part.
2. Update our dice rolling implementation as per what's on the Google Drive.
3. No more negative acknowledgement IDs! (implementing 0, 1, 2... ack_id's is quite a lot of work for minimal gain)
========== At this poiint we should be able to test with Saad's group ============
4. in NetworkPlayer, if we ever can't receive a message, tell the Game Logic we should be a neutral player.

-------- Not likely to get done
Warnings on some messages. Fix them!
Maybe stop receiveing PING messages when the host sends READY. This requires quite a re-architecture of the lobby code as far as I can tell
Maybe Check that unknown messages are ignored by the game at all important points.
Maybe also check that the host forwards unknown messages. The host should probably just forward line by line instead of parsing and resending. Does this happen already?
Maybe also timeout players if they take way too long. I'm not so keen on this though really.
------- Never actually going to get done.
Never implement message signing, nice idea but no group is going to get far enough to cheat. Talk about the theory in the report, because quite a lot of thought was put into this.

Everyone - Entire Report

James/Victor - Add all stages of game to GUIPlayer getMove and GUIPlayer updatePlayer

James/Victor - Make GUIPlayer safer so that it doesn't crash all the time

Adam - All of network changes required to make game protocol compliant - Test game with other group
Nathan - Logic RNG isnt protocol compliat


Everyone - Fix it so names are consistent across all games

Nathan - Implement a better AI
